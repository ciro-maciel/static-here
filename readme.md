Welcome to Static-Here
===================

I am Ciro, and this is a bit of my experience.

For over a year I have been using jekyll for some projects where I develop websites and parts of static html system.

Jekyll was taking good care of me and I started to ask about a simplified structure, fast, easy to handle, extensive, where I would have complete control of how I want to develop my application.

In this way I spent my time searching and testing some of the static site generators:

[Hexo](https://hexo.io/)
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
[Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/)

All found in this great documentation [Top Open-Source Static Site Generators](https://www.staticgen.com/)

I did not succeed. Such frameworks work very well for the purpose defined "Static Site Generators".

And, with the internet (and its technologies) becoming more and more dynamic, with better and better functional resources, faster and more optimized, I realized that I could go my way, joining the excellent work in many people from my point of view.

Thus was born Static-Here
